  **Features**
  - Jupyter notebook interface to control Arduino inside the box.
  - Synchronize up to 3 cameras (signal level: 3.3V).
  - Auditory stimulus by a built-in soundboard using wav files.
  - TTL trigger for one shocker (Med Associate XXXX).
  - Three 28V power supplies for fans and lights.
  - Digital IOs to send triggers to your recording system.
  - Generate sinusoidal analog signal to control two external LED drivers.
